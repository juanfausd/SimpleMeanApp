# Simple Mean App
Simple single page application using the MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) stack.

# Requirements
* Node.js
* MongoDB

# Start the App!
To start the application, just open the console and run the following command:

<code>node server.js</code>

By default, node will not monitor for file changes after your server has been started. This means youâ€™d have to shut down and start the server every time you made a file change. This can be fixed with nodemon. To use: install nodemon globally npm install -g nodemon. Start your server with nodemon server.js now.
